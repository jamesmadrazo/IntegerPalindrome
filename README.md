# Mersk-Challenge-number 6


## Project Brief
Problem 6: Integer Palindrome

Check if given Integer is palindrome or not. An integer is called palindrome if it's equal to its reverse, e.g. 1001 is a palindrome, but 1234 is not because the reverse of 1234 is 4321 which is not equal to 1234.
Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework. 
                                     
## Dependencies used
* JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api
- List any other dependencies you used i.e logger 

## Assumptions
- Null is a palindrome

 
## How to Run
    1. Open the project in Intellij
    2. Navigate to the Main.java file in the project explorer
    3. Run the main method

## Highlights
- The program works for even and odd length numbers
- The program accounts for single digits
- Program does not run longer than needed
- Program can be changed to work with String inputs if needed

## Improvements
- Could have accounted for the handling of null input, to define whether it is a palindrome or not
